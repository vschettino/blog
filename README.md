# My Personal Blog

This is where I edit and create new content to my [Blog](http://vschettino.com.br).

## How It Works

The [Blog](http://vschettino.com.br) is powered by [Grav](https://getgrav.org/) Using several plugins. Highlights for [GitSync](https://github.com/trilbymedia/grav-plugin-git-sync), that allows bi directional integration between my blog and this repository over Git, and to [Open Publishing Skeleton](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/grav-skeleton-open-publishing-space).
