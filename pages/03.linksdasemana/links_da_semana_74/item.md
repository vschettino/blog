1. Container-like structures shape the way programmers interact with computers and OS since the early days. This tale is [told by this nice article](https://dev.to/heroku/how-containers-changed-the-world-1jip), pointing out the main events that changed the way we develop and deploy software now.

1. Robert Martin's [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) is a best seller that presents us the tools to write better, fancier and more maintainable software.
[These guidelines](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) try to adhere to those principles using the Python's constructions and features, exploring the best of which language to write better software, as [done in other languages](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript).

1. [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is a tool heavily inspired on [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/), and it is getting more addeptions by the clock. The main advantages explained on [this article](https://www.tomasvotruba.com/blog/2020/01/27/switch-travis-to-github-actions-to-reduce-stress/) are performance and ease of use over [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/).

1. Statically typed Python is a new way of achieving higher levels of maintainability and debugging, and [mypi](http://mypy-lang.org/) allows you to optionally and gradually migrate your existing codebase. [Here are some tips](http://calpaterson.com/mypy-hints.html) on how to use and configure the tool for better results.

1. Be careful on NULL fields in SQL and [know how to avoid the common pitfalls](https://mitchum.blog/null-values-in-sql-queries/) whenever working with unknown values.
